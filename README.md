## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js, npm, mongodb, and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environment.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

    Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
    Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

    You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

    ##### Installation Commands

        $ sudo apt install nodejs
        $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems

    You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).
    If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    ##### verification Commands

        $ node --version
        v14.17.3 (recommended for this project)
        $ npm --version
        v7.20.5
    If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    ##### update Command

        $ npm install npm -g

### Yarn
